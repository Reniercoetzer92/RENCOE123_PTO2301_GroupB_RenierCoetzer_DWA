What is Higher-order functions: 


Higher-order functions are a concept in computer science and functional programming that refer to 
functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. In other words, 
a higher-order function treats functions as first-class citizens, just like any other data type such as 
integers or strings. This concept is closely associated with functional programming languages like Haskell,
Lisp, and JavaScript.

There are two main types of higher-order functions:

Functions that take functions as arguments: These are often used for tasks like mapping, filtering, and 
reducing over data collections. Examples of higher-order functions that take functions as arguments include:

* map: Takes a function and applies it to each element of a collection, returning a new collection with 
  the results.
* filter: Takes a function that returns a boolean value and filters a collection based on the condition 
  specified by that function.
* reduce (or fold): Takes a function that combines two values and applies it iteratively to reduce a 
  collection to a single value.
* Functions that return functions: These are used to create new functions with specialized behavior. 
  Examples include:

1. Function factories: A higher-order function that returns a function with specific characteristics or 
   configurations. For example, a function that generates different types of sorting functions.
2. Currying: A technique that converts a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions,
   each taking a single argument. This can be achieved through a higher-order function that partially 
   applies arguments and returns a new function.

Higher-order functions enable more flexible and modular code by promoting the reuse of functions and 
promoting a functional style of programming. They are a fundamental concept in functional programming and 
can lead to more concise and expressive code.

Utility functions and higher-order functions are both important concepts in programming, but they serve 
different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

1. Utility Functions:

* Purpose: Utility functions, also known as helper functions, are designed to perform specific tasks or 
  operations that are commonly needed throughout a program. They are typically used to simplify code, 
  improve readability, and avoid code duplication.
* Nature: Utility functions are generally not higher-order functions. They are often simple, standalone 
  functions that take input, perform a specific operation, and return a result. 
  They don't necessarily operate on other functions.
* Examples: Common utility functions might include functions for string manipulation 
  (e.g., toUpperCase, trim), mathematical operations (e.g., round, max, min), or date formatting (e.g., formatDate).

2. Higher-Order Functions:

* Purpose: Higher-order functions are designed to work with functions as their input or output. They are 
  used to abstract and manipulate the behavior of functions, enabling more flexible and modular code.
* Nature: Higher-order functions are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return 
  functions as results. They allow you to pass functions as data, enabling operations like mapping, 
  filtering, and composition of functions.
* Examples: Higher-order functions include map, filter, reduce, and functions that accept callbacks 
  (e.g., event handlers). They can also include function factories, currying, and functions that wrap 
  other functions with additional behavior (e.g., decorators).

In summary, utility functions are focused on providing convenient and reusable solutions for specific tasks, 
while higher-order functions are focused on abstracting and working with functions themselves to enable 
more advanced control over program logic and data transformations. Both concepts are valuable in different 
contexts and can be used together to create clean, modular, and efficient code.
