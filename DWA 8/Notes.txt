*   Object orientated programming
    The second paradigm to be adopted was actually discovered two years earlier. in 1966, by ole Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard.
    these two programmers noticed that the function call stack frame in the ALGOL language could be moved to a heap,
    there by allowing local variables declared by a function to exist long after the function returned.
    The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested
    functions became methods. This led inevitably to the discovery of polymorphism through the disciplined use of function pointers.
        We can Summarize the OOP paradigm as Follows:

        "OOP imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control"

*   Was main paradigm for long period of time.
*   Different flavours of OOP.
*   Class not the best name of Javascript.
*   Encapsulation in OOP?
