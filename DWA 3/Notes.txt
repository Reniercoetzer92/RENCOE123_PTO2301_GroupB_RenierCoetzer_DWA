# users story:

A user story is a concise, informal description of a feature or 
functionality from the perspective of an end user. It is commonly used in Agile software development 
methodologies to capture the needs and requirements of the users in a 
format that is easily understood by the development team.

A typical user story follows a simple template, often referred to as 
the "As a [user role], 
I want [goal/desire], so that 
[benefit/value]." Let's break down each component:

1.  "As a [user role]": This part identifies the specific user or stakeholder 
    who will benefit from or interact with the feature. 
    It helps to define the context and frame the story from a user's perspective. 
    For example, "As a registered user," or "As an administrator."

2.  "I want [goal/desire]": This section describes what the user wants to accomplish 
    or the specific functionality they desire. 
    It should focus on the user's intent or the problem they are trying to solve. 
    For example, "I want to search for products based on specific criteria," or "
    I want to be able to delete comments on a post."

3.  "So that [benefit/value]": This part explains the reason or the value that the user expects to 
    achieve by fulfilling their goal. It provides context and helps prioritize features based 
    on their perceived benefits. For example, "So that I can find the items I'm looking for more 
    easily," or "So that I can maintain a clean and organized discussion board."

User stories are intentionally brief and written in a user-centric language to encourage 
conversation and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders. 
They serve as placeholders for detailed discussions and serve as a basis for determining 
the scope and prioritization of work during the development process.

#Markdown:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text using simple syntax. 
It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of providing a simple way to 
write content for the web that is easy to read and write, while still being capable of 
being converted into HTML.

Markdown is designed to be human-readable even in its raw form, and it's often used to 
write documentation, README files, blog posts, forum posts, and other types of content that need 
to be formatted for the web. The syntax of Markdown is straightforward and intuitive, 
making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

Here are some key features of Markdown:

1.  Headers: Markdown allows you to create headers of different levels using hash symbols (#).
2.  Text Formatting: Markdown provides options for basic text formatting such as bold, italic, 
    and strikethrough using asterisks (*) or underscores (_).
3.  Lists: You can create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists using numbers, hyphens, or asterisks.
4.  Links: Markdown allows you to create hyperlinks by enclosing the link text in square 
    brackets ([]) and the URL in parentheses (()).
5.  Images: You can insert images using a similar syntax to links but with 
    an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning.
6.  Code Blocks: Code blocks can be created by indenting the text with four spaces or by 
    using triple backticks (```) before and after the code block. Syntax highlighting for 
    specific programming languages is also supported.
7.  Tables: Markdown provides a simple way to create tables using pipes (|) and hyphens (-).
8.  Blockquotes: You can create blockquotes by prefixing the text with a greater-than symbol (>).

Markdown is widely supported and can be easily converted into HTML or 
other formats using various tools and libraries. Many text editors, 
content management systems (CMS), and online platforms have built-in 
support for Markdown, making it a popular choice for writing and formatting web content.

#JS documentation\

JSDoc is a documentation generation tool and a syntax for adding documentation 
comments to JavaScript code. It is used to describe the structure, types, and 
purpose of functions, variables, and objects in JavaScript. 
JSDoc comments use a specific format that allows automated documentation generators 
to parse the comments and generate documentation in various formats, such as HTML, Markdown, or JSON.

JSDoc comments begin with the /** syntax and end with */. 
Within the comment block, you can use special tags to provide information about 
the code element being documented. These tags include @param to describe function parameters, 
@returns to describe the return value of a function, @typedef to define custom types, 
@class to document classes, and many more.

JSDoc comments are not only helpful for generating documentation, 
but also for providing better understanding and context for other developers who read 
and maintain the code. They serve as a form of self-documentation and can be especially 
useful in larger codebases or when collaborating with others.
