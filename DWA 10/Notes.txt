What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be 
treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables different classes to share a common Interface or base class, 
while still allowing each class to have its own specific implementations.

There are two main types of polymorphism: 
1. compile-time (also known as static) polymorphism
2. runtime (also known as dynamic) polymorphism.

* Compile-time Polymorphism: This is achieved through method overloading or operator overloading. 
  Method overloading involves defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists. 
  The correct method to be invoked is determined at compile-time based on the arguments provided. 
  Operator overloading involves defining how operators should behave when used with objects of a class.

* Runtime Polymorphism: This is achieved through method overriding. Method overriding occurs when a subclass 
  provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
  The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object that calls the method. 
  This is often accomplished through the use of virtual functions in languages like C++ or the @Override annotation 
  in languages like Java.

Polymorphism is a fundamental principle in OOP, allowing for more flexible and modular code by enabling the 
interchangeability of different classes through a common interface or base class.
